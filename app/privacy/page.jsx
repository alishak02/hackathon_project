            <h2 id="scope">Scope of this notice</h2>

            <p>
              This notice describes the{" "}
              <strong>current build of this application</strong>: a front-end
              platform with no deployed backend, no user accounts and no
              persistence layer. It is deliberately narrow rather than a
              template for a service that does not exist yet.
            </p>

            <h2 id="analyzer">Email headers you paste</h2>

            <p>
              The <Link href="/dashboard/analysis">header analyzer</Link> parses
              entirely in your browser using JavaScript that ships with the
              page. Pasted content is held in browser memory for the lifetime of
              the tab and is <em>never transmitted anywhere</em> — not to us,
              not to a third party.
            </p>

            <p>
              Clearing the field, navigating away or closing the tab discards
              it. Nothing is written to local storage, session storage or a
              cookie.
            </p>

            <p>
              This matters beyond privacy: a suspicious email is evidence, and
              forwarding it through additional systems creates copies you then
              have to account for.
            </p>

            <h2 id="contact-form">The contact form</h2>

            <p>
              Submitting the <Link href="/#contact">contact form</Link> sends the
              fields you filled in to the server, where they are validated. In
              this build the submission is{" "}
              <strong>logged and then discarded</strong> — there is no mail
              backend, no queue and no database, so nothing is stored or
              emailed to anyone.
            </p>

            <p>
              The success message on the form says exactly this rather than
              implying a human received it.
            </p>

            <p>
              The form also rejects credential-shaped content — private keys,
              anything matching a password or API-key pattern — before it is
              processed. Please still never send secrets.
            </p>

            <h2 id="cookies">Cookies and tracking</h2>

            <p>
              None. This application sets no cookies, loads no analytics or
              advertising scripts, and embeds no third-party tracking. There is
              no consent banner because there is nothing to consent to.
            </p>

            <h2 id="third-parties">Third parties</h2>

            <p>
              Fonts are <strong>self-hosted</strong>. The application uses
              Next.js font optimisation, which downloads the typefaces at build
              time and serves them from the same origin as the page — so your
              browser makes no request to Google Fonts, and no third party sees
              your IP address as a result of visiting.
            </p>

            <p>
              If this application is deployed to a hosting provider, that
              provider will process request logs (including IP addresses) as
              part of serving the site. That is outside this application&rsquo;s
              control and governed by the host&rsquo;s own terms.
            </p>

            <h2 id="rights">Your rights</h2>

            <p>
              Because no personal data is retained, there is nothing for us to
              retrieve, correct or erase on request. If a future deployment adds
              accounts or storage, this notice will be updated{" "}
              <em>before</em> that change ships, not after.
            </p>

            <h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>

            <p>
              The effective date at the top of this page changes whenever this
              notice does. Material changes to what is collected will be stated
              plainly rather than absorbed into a general revision.
            </p>

            <h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>

            <p>
              Questions about this notice:{" "}
              <a href={`mailto:${site.contactEmail}`}>{site.contactEmail}</a>.
              Security issues belong on the{" "}
              <Link href="/security">security page</Link> instead.
            </p>

                A privacy notice should describe what actually happens. This
